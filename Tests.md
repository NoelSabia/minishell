# Minishell Tests

## Mandatory

## May be/is a problem regarding the eval(s)
- (Check the global variable. This global variable cannot provide any other information or data access than the number of a received signal.) -> might be a problem cause we use a boolen
- (Test only spaces or tabs.) -> we get a similar output like ls or ls -la
- (Try ctrl-C after running a blocking command like cat without arguments or grep â€œsomethingâ€œ) -> we get minishell twice like this: ðŸŸ¢ minishell âžœ ðŸŸ¢ minishell âžœ 
- (echo '$USER' must print "$USER") -> prints user can be hardcoded i guess
- (ðŸŸ¢ minishell âžœ cd cd: (null): Bad address) -> go to root if cmd[0] == NULL
- (Unset the $PATH and ensure commands are not working anymore) -> seems like its not working
- ('cat | cat | ls' should behave in a "normal way") -> it does not

- (split with brackets) -> need to take a look into that problem
